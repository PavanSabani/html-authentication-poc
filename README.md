# HTML Authentication POC

This project is a basic HTML authentication proof of concept created using only plain HTML.

It contains 5 pages:

- login.html
- register.html
- forgot-password.html
- reset-password.html
- dashboard.html

All pages are connected using anchor tag redirections to simulate a simple authentication flow (Register → Login → Dashboard → Logout, and Forgot/Reset Password).
